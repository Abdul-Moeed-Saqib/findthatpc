## How It Works

1. **Input a Prebuilt PC Link**: Simply provide a link to a prebuilt PC from Micro Center or CanadaComputers.
2. **AI Analysis**: The AI verifies and matches components, filtering out irrelevant or duplicate items.
3. **Cost Comparison**: View side-by-side comparisons of prebuilt pricing versus component pricing.

### Components Covered:
- **CPU, GPU, Motherboard, RAM**
- **Storage, Cooling, Power Supply, Case**

> **Note**: The app ensures that components are verified as standalone and accurately matched.
